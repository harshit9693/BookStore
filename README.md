## Environmental Impact

Every year, millions of books are discarded, contributing to waste and environmental degradation. BookStore provides a solution by enabling users to sell their old books, promoting reuse, and reducing waste. By giving old books a new life, we help decrease the demand for new paper production, which in turn conserves natural resources and reduces deforestation.

## Admin Functionality

- Users can upload books with prices and descriptions.
- Admins can view and manage all orders, ensuring smooth transactions.
