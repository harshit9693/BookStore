BookStore
Overview
BookStore is a dynamic platform where users can buy and sell old books as well as purchase new ones. The application includes user authentication, an add-to-cart option with cart data saved in the database, and the ability for users to order books once signed in. It offers various categories of books for users to explore.

Environmental Impact
Every year, millions of books are discarded, contributing to waste and environmental degradation. BookStore provides a solution by enabling users to sell their old books, promoting reuse, and reducing waste. By giving old books a new life, we help decrease the demand for new paper production, which in turn conserves natural resources and reduces deforestation.

Admin Functionality
Users can upload books with prices and descriptions.
Admins can view and manage all orders, ensuring smooth transactions.
